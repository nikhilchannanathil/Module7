# SAS Capstone Project - Outline
The main objective of this project is to perform a broader analysis on the mortality rate between adults and children across different regions in the world. This study will help to provide an understanding of mortality rate between children and adults. And helps to identify most dangerous cause of mortality in adults and children globally and to take informed actions to reduce the mortalities. To address the key research objectives, I have used SAS to perform both inferential statistic and descriptive statistics. The input data set for this project is taken from WHO portal [Deaths attributable to the environment, by disease and region Estimates](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.ENVDEATHSBYDISEASE?lang=en)

## How to use this repository
The subfolder contains the SAS program, input file and project output. 

## Considerations
I built these projects using my local PC based install of SAS. I have uploaded the input file in SAS for processing. To move this project to another operating environment or path you need to change any paths defined by `libname` and `filename` statements. 

## Hypothesis tested in this study
* Null and alternate hypothesis
    Ho (Null hypothesis):  There is no significant difference in the mortality rate between children (age 0-4 years) and adults.
    Ha (Alternate hypothesis):  There is a significant difference in the mortality rate between children (age 0-4 years) and adults.

## Project Result and future recomendations
The research result shows that there is a significant difference in the mortality rate between children and adults. But this study was done on data collected by WHO for the year of 2012.  This data limitation may result bias in this research study. So further research is recommended with larger group of data to achieve more accurate results.
